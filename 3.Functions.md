# Introduction To Functions

What are functions you ask?

**Let's use a microwave as an example**. You notice on a microwave there's alway a button like "pizza" or "reheat" that let's us easily press one button to cook that meal? _These buttons are functions of a microwave_

Same thing in python. There's functions that we constantly use that makes our lives easier. 

**We can create our own functions, OR use functions that are already built into python:**
- You all have already been using one type of built in function already: ```print()```

# Built In Functions

Here are some built in functions:
- ```print()``` You should be very familiar with this already
- ```int()``` converts anything inside of ```()``` into an integer
- ```str()``` converts anything inside of ```()``` into a string
- ```abs()``` absolute value
- ```min()``` gets the minimum value of two values inside of it
- ```max()``` gets the max value of the two values inside of it

# Creating our own Functions

**In general**: Functions in python are simplify blocks of code that we can we can create
- **It only runs when we call them.** 
- The point of functions is to re-use code and to make our lives easier
- You can "pass" arguments into functions
	- Notice how when you print something, you type the thing you want to print between the parantheses? (), you are **passing** the string/variable/etc. into the `print()` function


Here's the basic structure of a function:
```python

def functionName(...): #You can place variables here so that you can use it. These are called parameters
	#Everything inside of the function is indented.
	#This is to show that the code that's indented belongs to the function
	return ... #If you want a function to output/give back something, you use the 'return' keyword
```

When you've finished creating the function and **you want to use it**, you need to **call it**

```python
#function is written up top here
...

print("This is my function:")
functionName() #You are calling the function by typing the name with ()
```

# Custom Function Example:

## Adding two numbers

Let's create a simple function that adds two numbers together:
```python
def addBoth(number1, number2):
	return number1 + number2
```

Now if we want to use it...

```python
print("Adding", 1, "with", 2):
result = addBoth(1, 2)
print(result)
```

Together:
```python
def addBoth(number1, number2):
	return number1 + number2

print("Adding 1 with 2"):
result = addBoth(1, 2) #I am storing the result of addBoth(1,2) into the variable result
print(result)

print("Let's add 3 and 4")
print(addBoth(3,4)) #If I just want to print the values without storing it, I can do this

```


## Printing stuff:
Say I want to print movie lines from star wars for some reason. I could do this:

```python
def sayMovieLines():
	print("It's over Anakin! I have a the High Ground!")
	print("You underestimate my power")
	print("Don't try it")
	#notice how I don't have a 'return' keyword here. I'm not outputing anything

print("Prequel Lines:")
sayMovieLines()
```
