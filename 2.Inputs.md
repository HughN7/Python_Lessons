# General Input:
Asking for the time from the user
```python
print("What time is it?")
someVariableName = input() #prompts for user input
print(f"it is {someVariableName}")
```
This also works:
```python
someVariableName = input("What time is it?") #prompts for user input
print(f"it is {someVariableName}")
```

# Number Input
**remember**, ```input()``` stores input as a **string**/words, phrases, strings of letters

**To take in a number input:**
```python
print("What number do you want to store in the variable?")
someNumber = int(input())
```
- We are using something called a **Built in Function** in order to convert a string into an integer

## Converting Number into String

Reminder: Strings are words, phrases, sequence of characters
- think "String of letters"

**If you wanted to convert a number into a string:**
```python
print("Enter some number")
someNumber = int(input())
stringFromNumber = str(someNumber) #CONVERSION HERE
print(type(stringFromNumber)) #this should printout str
```
```
