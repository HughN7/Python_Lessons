# Lists
Lists are a type of datastructure used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
- In other programming languages we use something similar called _arrays_ although they are less flexible.

```python
#Lists is a type of datastructure to store multiple items in a variable
aList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(aList)
```
```python
#They can store anything and you can mix and match
tooManyLists = ["Hello There", True, "General Kenobi!", 420]
print(tooManyLists)
```

## Accessing Items inside a List
In order to access a list, **we need to access it by it's index using the ```[]```square brackets:**

```python
#To access a list, we access it by it's index
#EVERYTHING STARTS AT 0
hotel = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four"]
print(f"There are {len(hotel)} rooms")
print(hotel[0]) #This should print "zero"
```

## Adding items to a List
We can add items to a list by using ```.append()```
```python
#To add stuff to a list
hotelRooms = [112,113,114,115,116]
print(hotelRooms[2])
print(hotelRooms) #before adding
hotelRooms.append(117)
print(hotelRooms) #after adding
```

## Removing items from a List
We can remove items from a list by using ```.pop()```
```python
#To remove stuff from a list
moreHotelRooms = [112,113,114,115,116,177]
print(moreHotelRooms) #before removing
moreHotelRooms.pop() #removes the end of the list
print(moreHotelRooms) #after removing
```

There is a way to remove items from a specific index of a list, but I'll let you read that on your own. 

## Copying A List
The main way to copy items from a list into another list is to use ```list()```

```python
#If you want to copy a list, you have to use copy() or list()
ohGoshMoreLists = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
duplicateList = list(ohGoshMoreLists)
```

# Looping Through a List
Since we mentioned above we can access list items based on their index like this:

```python
someList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
print(someList[0]) #This will print 1 (remember everything starts at 0)
```

Therefore, **you can also loop through lists like this:**
```python
someList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
for index in range(0, len(someList)): #length of list
	print(someList[index])
```

**You can also access it with a while loop**
```python
someList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
index = 0
while index < len(someList):
	print(someList[index])
	index = index + 1 #you can also use index+=1 here
```

# Treating Strings as Lists
```python
#You can also treat strings as lists
someString = "Hello There!"
print(someString[0]) #This will print 'H'
```

# List Slicing
A special feature of lists in python is that we can do something called **slicing**. Basically it's a way to manipulate/generate lists so that we can obtain parts of the list or even reverse it. 

The syntax for it is ```list[beginning index: stopping index: iteration]```
- Note that beginning index, stopping index, and iteration are all optional

#List slicing is a feature exclusive to python
#It's a neat trick to easily modify and access parts of a list
#Even I don't remember everything about this topic

#List slicing: Creatng a new list from another list

aList = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(aList[2:5]) #this prints out [3,4,5]

#The syntax follows this:
# list[begin: end: step]
# it does not print the end. When it sees the end, it stops

#This means you can do cool tricks like reversing a list
anotherList = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(anotherList[::-1]) #reverses the list
print(anotherList[::2]) #prints only every two indexes
print(anotherList[5:3:-1]) #prints indexes 3 & 4 in reverse

#And yes, all of this, applies to strings
someString = "Hello There!"
print(someString[::-1])
```
