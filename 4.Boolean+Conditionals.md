# Booleans and Conditionals
Booleans are basically true or false

```python
didEatLunch = False
didSleep = True
```

Conditionals are **if else statements**

```python
if(didEatLunch == False): #paranthesese is optional
	print("go eat lunch!")
```

```python
if(didSleep == True):
	print("You should feel refreshed")
else:
	print("Remember to shower before sleeping!")
```

```python
if(didSleep == True):
	print("You should feel refreshed")
elif(didEatLunch == True):
	print("Do you feel full?")
else:
	print("Go get some food and take a nap!")
```

# String Comparison
You can compare two strings with each other
```python
print("hello" == "hello")
```
```python
if("Hello" == "hello"):
	print("the two strings match!")
else:
	print("the two strings don't match!")
```

**modify turtle so that based on input it prints only the second circle or all circles**

## Boolean Expressions / Comparison Operators
We're familiar with arithmetic (math) expressions yes?
- 3 + 2 (addition)
- 3 - 2 (subtraction)
- 3 * 2 (multiplication)
- 3 / 2 (division with the remainder)
- 3 // 2 (division without the remainder)
- 3 ** 2 (exponents)
- 3 % 2 (finding out remainder)

Now we also learn about _boolean/comparison operators_
- ```>``` greater than
- ```>=``` greater than or equal to
- ```<``` less than
- ```<=``` less than or equal to
- ```==``` equal to (this is the same as = in math)
- ```!=``` NOT equal to

Example:
```python
if(10 > 5):
	print("this is definitely true")
else:
	print("for some reason in this universe, 10 is not greater than 5")
```

**Question: Will the elif run?**
```python
if(10 > 5):
	print("Yep this is true"):
elif(10 > 7):
	print("Sure")
else:
	print("What the f...")
```
