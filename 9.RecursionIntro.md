# Recursion
AKA: **Inception but with code**

Recursion is simply when a function calls itself. 
- Generally used to break down problems
- Can also be sometimes used to substitute loops.

For example:

```python
def sayHello(howManyTimes):
	if howManyTimes == 0:
		return 

	print("hello")
	howManyTimes-=1
	sayHello(howManyTimes)
	
```

Pros:
1. Recursion can make code more concise and elegant.
2. Recursive algorithms are often easier to understand and reason about (at a basic level)
3. Recursion can be an effective way to solve problems that have a similar structure or pattern.

Cons:
1. Recursive algorithms can be more difficult to debug and maintain.
2. **Recursive algorithms can be less efficient than non-recursive algorithms.**
3. Recursion can be difficult to understand for beginners.
