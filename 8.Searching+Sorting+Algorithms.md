# Before We Start...
If you're going to learn about algorithms and datastructures, you're going to need to know this. 

1. **Algorithm** - Fancy word for step by step process on how to make/do stuff.
   - When we made Tic Tac Toe and we made a function that finds the winner. That's technically an algorithm. 
3. **Data Structures** - A thing that you use to store and organize data
   -  Lists are data structures that we've been using.

# Searching and Sorting Intro

The three bigger topics in computer science is: 
1. Sorting (using algorithms)
2. Searching (using algorithms)
3. Storing (using data structures)

When learning any of these topics, it's much to better to have a visual breakdown. You'll see a lot of links to videos and articles throughout this lesson. 

**We'll be focusing on Sorting & Searching for this note**

# Sorting algorithms
Do watch this video as an intro to sorting algorithms:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNLJf8xzC4

We're going to implement **bubble sort** and **insertion sort** here. 

I'll show **selection sort** in class. 
- Selection sort is usually the first sorting algorithm you'll learn. 
- Selection sort reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PGLbMth_g

## Bubble Sort

The second sorting algorithm you'll generally learn. 
- Basically the idea is to keep swapping elements that are next to each other.
- You swap when the current element you're on is bigger than the next element.
- Eventually you'll have the highest element moved to the end of the array/vector.
- Hence the elements "bubble/float" to the "top/end" of the array/vector.
- Good visual reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xli_FI7CuzA
```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
	for outerIndex in range(0, len(arr)):
		for index in range(0, len(arr)-1):
			if arr[index] > arr[index+1]:
				arr[index], arr[index+1] = arr[index + 1], arr[index]
				
	return arr
```

## Insertion Sort
The third sorting algorithm you'll learn. 
- visual reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU767SDMDvA
- The basic idea is to go through the array.
- Look at the current index/element and compare it to the previous
	- If the current element is less than the previous, continually **shift** & compare **until it's no longer less than the neighboring previous element**
- Essentially what insertion does conceptually, is doing the opposite of bubble sort.
	- In a way we're "bubbling down" with insertion sort. Except we're **shifting** instead of **swapping**
  - It's easier if you look at the visual reference to imagine this

```python
def insertionSort(arr):
	for outerIndex in range(0, len(arr)):
		selected = arr[outerIndex]
		index = outerIndex
		while index > 0 and selected < arr[index -1]:
			arr[index] = arr[index-1]
			index-=1
		arr[index] = selected
	return arr
```


## More Advanced Sorting Algorithms
Of course there's more. But after you learn the basic three, look into
- Merge Sort `O(n*log(n))`
- Radix Sort `O(n*k)` k being the number of digits that are part of the input
- Quick Sort `O(n*log(n))`

These are _much_ faster than the basic three. 


# Search algorithms

Search algorithms are algorithms that... search stuff. 
- This is a basic introduction to searching algorithms. Particularly linear search and binary search.
- There are some more advanced algorithms but you'll have learn datastructures for those

## Linear Search
You should be pretty familiar to the regular **linear search algorithm**
- AKA, if you want to find something in an array/vector. You go through every single element in the array to find the one you're looking for
- It's called **linear** since we **potentially** have to go through **every single element** in the vector/array to find the target (`O(n)`)
	- Remember that big O notation assumes the _worst case scenario_

```python
def linearSearchIndex(arr, target):
	for index, number in arr:
		if number == target:
			return index
	return -1
```

## Binary Search
The goal of this algorithm is to "divide and conquer". We'll be dividing the array/vector into two constantly to find our target
- **Binary** = two
	- We're splitting stuff into two. Hence why it's called **Binary** Search.

 First off, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFhxShGxHWc
	- He uses recursion to do it though and in js, we'll do it iteratively

**There is a small catch when using Binary Search**
- Your datastructure (array, vector, etc.) MUST be **sorted**


```python
def binarySearchIndex(arr, target):
	start, end = 0, len(arr) - 1

	while start <= end:
		middle = start + (end - start)//2

		if arr[middle] == target:
			return middle
		elif target > arr[middle]:
			start = middle + 1
		else:
			end = middle - 1 

	return -1
```

## More advanced searching algorithms 
Of course there are more searching algorithms but again, this is just an intro. 
- In general, most other searching algorithms apply to other datastructures than lists, vectors and arrays. You'll have to learn those first.
