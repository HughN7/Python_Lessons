# Variables
**The computer sciency definition:** Variables are containers for storing data values

**The normal english definition:** 
- Think of variables like a box,
	- We can name that box whatever we want.
- We can also put whatever we want inside of that box, _including magical strings that lead to other boxes._
- We can also access whatever is inside the box and manipulate it
	- example: Doing math on it

```python
variableName = "Hello"
anotherVariableName = 2
soManyVariables = anotherVariable + 1000
anotherVariableName = anotherVariableName + 1
```

```python
cookies = "yum"
cookiesClone = cookies #This is the magical string I was talking about
```

## Data types
But this is python, a programming language, so we gotta talk about datatypes. 

Going back to our earlier definition of what variables are, **datatypes is just a fancy word to tell what type of stuff is stored in the variable/box**

In this class, we'll be dealing with:
- **Strings** (strings of characters / words, sentences, letters, etc.)
	- *A simplified explanation: Anything that you've typed so far that's surrounded by `""` are strings*
- **Integers** (numbers without decimals)
- **Floats** (numbers with decimals)

There's more datatypes that we won't worry about yet but you can read them here:

## Doing Math
Yes yes, the boring stuff. But it's _important_. You can do math on variables and with most code in python. But you need to learn the symbols
- ```+``` Add
- ```-``` Subtract
- ```*``` Multiply
- ```/``` Divide
- ```//``` Divide, but without remainders or decimals
- ```%``` Modulus (Find the remainder after a divide)
- ```**``` Power

Some Examples:
```python
x = 2
x = x + 1 #Adds 1 to x
print(x) #Should print 3
```
```python
x = 3
x = x / 2 #divides whatever is in x by 2
print(x) #3/2 = 1.5
```
```python
x = 3
x = x // 2 #divides whatever is in x by 2 and removes the decimal
print(x) #3/2 = 1.5 but if you remove the decimals, then it becomes 1
```
```python
x = 7
x = x % 2 #Finds the remainder if x is divided by 2
print(x) #7/2 = 3 remainder 1. So answer is 1
```
```python
x = 7
x = x ** 2 #Raises x to the power of 2
print(x) #7^2 == 7 * 7 == 49
```

There's also a shorter way to write code when you're doing math. Here's the regular way to do it:
```python
x = 2
x = x + 2 #Regular way to write this
```

And here is the shorter way to write it:
```python
x = 2
x += 2 #This is the same thing as x = x + 2
```

This applies to other math operations as well. For example:
```python
x *=2
x /=2
```

# Printing words/letters with variables

We're now using python3. So now I'll show you f strings
```python
someNumber = 2
print(f"I like to have {someNumber} cookies")
```
Notice the ```f``` in front of the ```"```. F strings are a way to format text so that we don't have to wierdly do ```+ str()```. The variable we want to print inside of the string is surrounded by curly braces ```{}```

You can also print words with variables using comma's. 
- Each comma represents a space 

```python
someNumber = 2
print("I like to have", someNumber , "cookies")
```
