# Random
Generates random numbers
```python
import random
print(random.random())
```
```python
from random import random
print(random())
```
Generates a Random Number between 0 and 5
```python
from random import random
print(random.randrange(0,5))
```

# Loops
Loops are way for us to repeat code. There are two main types of loops in python:
- For loop
- While Loop

**For loop** is usually reserved for things that we know how many repititions it will take. **While loops** are generally for things that we don't know how many times we need to repeat code. We can also create  **infinite loops** using a while loop (A loop that runs forever).
- Technically a for loop is just a specialized while loop. 
- **You can also exit any sort of loop using the ```break``` statement**

```python
#Example of for Loop
#index is just a variable we created inside of the for loop
for index in range(0,4):
	print(f"we are currently at index {index}")
	print("Hello")
```
---
```python
#Example of a while loop
index = 0
while index < 5:
	print("There")
	index+=1
```
---
```python
#Example of an infinite Loop
while True:
	print("General Kenobi!")

#How do you get out of an infinite loop?
#- there has to be a condition and we use the break command
anotherIndex = 0
while True:
	print("You are a bold one!")
	if anotherIndex == 1:
		print("Exiting loop")
		break
	anotherIndex+=1
```

You can also have **Nested loops (loop within a loop)**. Just note that nesting loops is a **very very bad from a performance perspective**. If you decide to go into advanced classes, you'll learn about big O notation and learn why. Only nest loops if it's absolutely necessary. 

```python
#nested loops
#note: NESTED LOOPS ARE VERY VERY BAD. DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY

#imagine you had to make 5 peperroni pizza. 
#you need a loop that runs five times right?
#BUT: every time you need to make the pizza. You need to place 25 pieces of pepperoni
#this is another loop that runs 25 times
pizzaCount = 5
for pizzaNumber in range(0, pizzaCount):
	print(f"Making pizza number: {pizzaNumber}")
	for pepperoniNumber in range(0, 25):
		print(f"Placing pepperoni {pepperoniNumber} on pizza {pizzaNumber}")
```
