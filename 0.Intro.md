# Hello There

**Welcome to the introduction to python course.**
- Instructor: Hieu (Please don't call me Mr.Vo)

**Why learn python?**
- Simplest language (compared to many others)
- Powerful language (Machine Learning & Data Science)
- Gets your feet wet to learn other programming languages

We'll focus on learning on how to use python, then applying the stuff from python to use turtle or create ascii games. 
- Turtle: A graphical tool/library that we'll be using to draw stuff on the screen.

# Hello World
We have this super super _weird_ tradition when learning a new programming language by printing "Hello World" to the screen

**Write this in main.py:**
```python
print("Hello World")
```

This is how you print things to the screen in python.  
- You have to type the word ```print``` with the parantheses ```()```
- Inside of the parantheses, _You're gonna have to use quotation marks if you want to print letters/words_

**But you could also use single quotes instead:**
```python
print('Hello World')
```

# Printing Reserved Characters
In all progamming laguages, there's something called **special characters/reserved words**

for example, ```""``` is a reserved character since we need to use it to print stuff to the screen. Same thing with single quotes ```''```

If you want to print these out, then you need to use another special character called a **backslash(```\```)**

```python
print("Hello \"There\"")
```
Remember, I used a **backslash, NOT a forward slash (```/```)**

Because of this we can do all sorts of interesting stuff, like printing a bear
```python
#https://www.asciiart.eu/animals/bears
print(" __         __")
print("/  \\.-'''-./  \\")
print("\    -   -    /")
print(" |   o   o   |")
print(" \  .-'''-.  /")
print("  '-\__Y__/-'")
print("     `---`")
```

Or maybe a stick figure:
```python
print(" O\n- -\n |\n/ \\")
```

But you noticed above I used ```\n```? The backslash not only lets us print special characters, we can also do other stuff with it like jumping to the next line with ```\n```. 

For example without ```\n``` it would be like this (try running this code):

```python
print(" O- - |/ \\")
```
It doesn't look right yes? You would need to do the following if you didn't have the ```\n```:
```python
print(" 0 ")
print("- -")
print(" | ")
print("/ \\") #I need to use a double back slash here in order to print 1 backslash on the screen
```

# With all programming languages, we can do math
```python
print(1+1) #Addition
print(1-1) #Subtraction
print(2*2) #Multiplication
print(7/2) #Division
print(7//2) #Division but without remainder/decimal/fraction
print(7%2) #Finding the remainder
print(7**2) #Exponents
```

We'll go over all of the above later, **Just notice that when I'm doing math, I did NOT use quotation marks**

But what if I did? Try this code below:
```python
print("1+1") #What will this print?
```
See what it prints out. And maybe you'll finally understand why you have to remember your quotation marks

# Commenting/Creating Notes in Code

So notice on top, I have been using this symbol ```#``` in my code?
- This is called comments, it's a way for us to create notes in code.

```python
print("Hello there")
#Comments are not run when you execute the code
#They're simply used to create notes
#Especially if you're working with other people in a single code base
```

Now notice at the top I had to use multiple ```#``` everytime I created notes right? **There is a way to create multiline comments so I don't have to use ```#``` on every new line**

- We can use 3 single quotes:
```python
print("Hello there")
'''
Comments are not run when you execute the code
They're simply used to create notes
Especially if you're working with other people in a single code base
'''
```
- Or double quotes
```python
print("Hello there")
"""
Comments are not run when you execute the code
They're simply used to create notes
Especially if you're working with other people in a single code base
"""
```

# SPACING IS IMPORTANT IN PYTHON
This is a giant no no:
```python
print("Hello")
	print("World")
 print(1+2)
```

Spacing is important in python. You should have no spaces/tabs in front of your code UNLESS we're dealing with conditions/functions/etc. (More on this in the coming weeks)

# Turtle + Reading Errors

Intro code:
```python
import turtle

#Setting up 
turtle.shape("turtle")
turtle.speed(10) #1-10

#First Circle
turtle.penup() #lift the pen up (remember that with turtle, it's like drawing with a pen and paper)
turtle.color("blue") #set pen color to yellow
turtle.fillcolor("green") #set shape fill to yellow
turtle.begin_fill() #starting fill
turtle.pendown() #set the pen down
turtle.circle(50) #create a circle
turtle.end_fill() #end the fill

#Second Circle
turtle.penup()
turtle.forward(25)
turtle.color("green")
turtle.fillcolor("blue")
turtle.begin_fill()
turtle.pendown()
turtle.circle(50)
turtle.end_fill()

#Everything afterwards (Text, movement etc. )
turtle.penup()
turtle.goto(-50,-40)
turtle.color('black')
turtle.write("Welcome to turtle", align="center ")
turtle.goto(10,-80)
```
